You are given a table, Functions, containing two columns: X and Y. Y is the value of some function F at X -- i.e. Y = F(X).
Two pairs (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are said to be symmetric pairs if X1 = Y2 and X2 = Y1.

Write a query to output all such symmetric pairs in ascending order by the value of X.



SELECT f1.X, f1.Y FROM Functions AS f1 
WHERE f1.X = f1.Y AND
(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Functions WHERE X = f1.X AND Y = f1.Y) > 1
UNION
SELECT f1.X, f1.Y from Functions AS f1
WHERE EXISTS(SELECT X, Y FROM Functions WHERE f1.X = Y AND f1.Y = X AND f1.X < X)
ORDER BY X;
